Language: Python

Goal of these project is a program that can compute the coordinates of a point after several transformations.  
To make it nice and clean, you chose to use homogeneous coordinates.     
(We were not allowed to use any matrix calculation library.)      
O being the origin of both axis, here are the transformations that we implemented:   
  - Translation
  - Scaling
  - Rotation centered at O
  - Reflection over any axis that passes through O
  - Any combination of the previous transformations
